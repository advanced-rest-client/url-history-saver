  /**
   * An element that saves Request URL in the history and serves list
   * of saved URLs.
   *
   * The `url-history-query` event expects the `q` property set on the `detail`
   * object. It is passed to the `query()` function and result of calling this
   * function is set on detail's `result` property.
   *
   * ### Example
   *
   * ```javascript
   *
   * const e = new CustomEvent('url-history-query', {
   *  detail: {
   *    q: 'http://mulesoft.com/path/'
   *  },
   *  cancelable: true,
   *  bubbles: true,
   *  composed: true // if fired in shaddow DOM
   * });
   * document.body.dispatchEvent(e);
   *
   * e.detail.result.then((urls) => console.log(urls));
   * ```
   *
   * The `url-history-store` requires the `value` property to be set on
   * the `detail` object and it is passed to the `store()` function.
   *
   * ### Example
   *
   * ```javascript
   * const e = new CustomEvent('url-history-store', {
   *  detail: {
   *    value: 'http://mulesoft.com/path/'
   *  },
   *  cancelable: true,
   *  bubbles: true,
   *  composed: true
   * });
   * document.dispatchEvent(e);
   * ```
   *
   * Both events are cancelled and propagation of the event is stopped.
   * Therefore the event should be dispatched with `caneclable` flag set to true.
   *
   * The element listens for events on the `window` object so it can be placed
   * anywhere in the DOM.
   *
   * ### Example
   *
   * ```html
   * <body>
   *  <url-history-saver></url-history-saver>
   * </body>
   * ```
   *
   * ## New in version 2
   *
   * - query event always set `result` and does not set `error` propery on `detail`
   * - PouchDB is not included with this element
