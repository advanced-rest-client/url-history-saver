# 1.0.0 (2018-05-12)


### Update

* Added sauce labs connection to Travis configuration ([5bbcbff25bf633a994248153ef70c75b4096569a](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/url-history-saver/commit/5bbcbff25bf633a994248153ef70c75b4096569a))
* Tried to fix tests for IE and Edge but they failed to create a browser that works so I'm not bothered anymore. You want have tests for IE - write them yourself. It's not code's issue, it's browser's ([8945d487a7d4c5bd4397e36d8e6cb92729c23b4d](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/url-history-saver/commit/8945d487a7d4c5bd4397e36d8e6cb92729c23b4d))
